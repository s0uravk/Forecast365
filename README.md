Project Proposal: Data Extraction, Transformation, and Visualization

**1. Introduction:**

The goal of this project is to extract, transform, and serve data from various industries using PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and the yfinance Python module. The extracted data will be loaded into PostgreSQL, transformed as per requirements, and served using Flask with various endpoints. Additionally, interactive visualizations will be created using D3 for stock data extracted using the yfinance Python module.

**2. Project Phases:**

**Phase 1: Data Extraction, Transfromation and Loading**
Extract data for each industry from relevant sources using Jupyter notebook.
Transform the data by changing data types and adding new columns as per the project requirements.
Union the data to create a comprehensive dataset for further processing.
Load the extracted data into PostgreSQL render.

**Phase 2: Data Serving**
Serve the transformed data using Flask with various endpoints to provide access to different subsets of the data based on user requirements.

**Phase 3: Interactive Visualization**
Utilize D3 to create interactive visualizations for the stock data extracted using the yfinance Python module.
The visualizations will provide an engaging and insightful way to explore the stock data across different industries.

**3. Technologies and Tools:**
yfinance and Alpha vantage Python module for extracting stock data.
PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
SQL Server for extracting and transforming data.
Flask for serving the data through various endpoints.
D3 for creating interactive visualizations.

**4. Deliverables:**
Comprehensive dataset in PostgreSQL containing industry-specific data.
Transformed data from SQL Server with updated data types and new columns.
Flask application with various endpoints for serving the data.
Interactive visualizations for stock data using D3.

**5. Conclusion:**
This project aims to provide a robust solution for extracting, transforming, and serving industry-specific data while also offering engaging interactive visualizations for stock data. The use of modern technologies and tools will ensure a high-quality deliverable that meets the project's objectives.
